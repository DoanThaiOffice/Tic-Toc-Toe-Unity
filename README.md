# Tic Tac Toe :x: :o:
The classic game noughts and crosses created in Unity.  

Using UI elements and a simple game controller we re-created Tic-tac-toe. Players can set there names in the input fields and then you just mark three in a row to win!

## Optimizations :pencil2:
Checkecing for any current win condition can probably be optimised, {EndTurn();} however this is such a simple game the overhead just is not there to worry about
